# Contributing To Julia

This document tracks some ways to get involved in the Julia ecosystem - the language itself, packages, educational material, and more. You can contribute to this document by [editing this file](https://github.com/IainNZ/ContributeToJulia/edit/master/README.md) in your browser and submitting a pull request.

## Important Packages

Julia includes a standard library, `Base`, with a lot of useful functionality. Lots of important functionality lives outside of `Base` in various packages, many of which are small enough for even a new user to understand. Contributing to these packages will benefit large numbers of people, as they are depended on by large numbers of other packages directly and indirectly.
